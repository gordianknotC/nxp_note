### Transient Properties

Properties declares in a managed object subclass are called  _transient_  because they are not stored in a database. For example, consider an  `Author`  type that stores first and last name as separate columns. Instead of redundantly storing a 'full name' in the database

```dart
class Author extends ManagedObject<_Author> implements _Author {
  String get name => "$firstName  $lastName";
  set name(String fullName) {
    firstName = fullName.split(" ").first;
    lastName = fullName.split(" ").last;
  }
}
```
By default, a transient property is ignored when reading an object from a request body or writing the object to a response body (see the guide on  [serialization](https://aqueduct.io/docs/db/serialization/)  for more details). 

> ⚡ You can annotate a transient property with  `Serialize`   so that it is able to be **read from a request body**, **written to a response body**, or both. For example:

```dart
class Author extends ManagedObject<_Author> implements _Author {
  @Serialize()
  String get name => "$firstName  $lastName";

  @Serialize()
  set name(String fullName) {
    firstName = fullName.split(" ").first;
    lastName = fullName.split(" ").last;
  }
}
```

### Example: One-to-Many Relationship

An author has many books:

```dart
class Author extends ManagedObject<_Author> implements _Author {}
class _Author {
  @primaryKey
  int id;

  String name;

  ManagedSet<Book> books;
}

class Book extends ManagedObject<_Book> implements _Book {}
class _Book {
  @primaryKey
  int id;

  String name;

  @Relate(#books)
  Author author;
}
```
